# Liri Node App

## Instructions

* The goal is to search up concerts, songs, movies, and "do-what-it-says" info.

* You can go clone my repo and have the git bash terminal ready. Once you cloned it, go into the repo through the terminal and type these options:
- node liri.js concert-this '<>' (type an artist or a band in between the arrows)
- node liri.js spotify-this-song '<>' (type a song that you can find in spotify in between the arrows)
- node liri.js movie-this '<>' (type a movie in between the arrows)
- node liri.js do-what-it-says 

* Here are some examples:
